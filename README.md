Misinformation on social media platforms is rampant, from vaccine hesitancy to climate change. Policymakers and researchers regularly point to the lack of resources allocated by social media platforms to content moderation, especially in non-English languages and in the [Global South](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/24/frances-haugen-i-never-wanted-to-be-a-whistleblower-but-lives-were-in-danger), where independent fact-checking firms are also more rare. This creates a need to develop new public goods to detect misinformation on social media and to implement online interventions to reduce it. Combating misinformation could have especially high dividends on Twitter, where a few individuals influence the policy debates, attitudes and behaviors of millions â€“ directly and indirectly through spillovers within Twitter and to other social media platforms. 

We present our work that tentatively focuses on analyzing the production and diffusion of misinformation, prioritizing  health and climate change; however, the techniques developed for the analysis are sector agnostic and transferable at a relatively low cost to other sectors (e.g., conflict, social cohesion). In this public repository we outline our methodolgy for detecting misinformation online to ease replication. Find out which features we have assembled and how to set up the methodology for your personal use cases. You can also [report bugs here](https://github.com/TryShape/tryshape/issues/new/choose).
