# Models

In this section of our GitHub repository, you will be able to find the models that we employ. 
In particular, you will be able to utilize the following large language models (LLMs) from Hugging Face, which we have finetuned for our analyses:

**List of models:**
- [gte-large](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-large): A 335 million parameter model, which we employ to compute the semantic similarity between fact-checked claims and social media posts such as tweets.
- [gte-small](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-small): The reduced, 33 million parameter version of [gte-large](https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-large), which we additional finetuned for those with limited computing resources.
