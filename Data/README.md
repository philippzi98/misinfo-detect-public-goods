# Data

In this section of our GitHub repository, you will be able to find all data sets. Please note that our data on tweets is too large in size to be shared via GitHub (>1.6 billion tweets and multiple TB of storage).
For those interested in using the Twitter data for their research efforts, please do not hesitate to reach out via [e-mail](mailto:sfraiberger@worldbank.org).
